# ls4rexx

**ls4rexx** is a REXX specific implementation of the 
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
and can be used with any editor that supports the protocol. 

I have started this project since I did not find any open source Eclipse IDE plugin
for this language. REXX is widely used on the Mainframe platform comparable to Perl on Unix.
Since I use this language on a daily basis I thought it worth my while to have a look
into how much work it would be to implement an editor support for this language.

This is still a work in progress and as the license states there is no guarantee that this 
project will be helpful to anyone (or ever be finished). I do not plan a full syntax check 
for the language and think of this project more in the line of a  _good-enough-support_  for
the developer to help with navigation and code completion.

The server is based on:

* [Eclipse lsp4j](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4j), the Java binding for the Language Server Protocol.
* [JFlex](https://jflex.de/), a lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner generator) for Java, written in Java.

I want to give kudos to [Angelo Zerr](https://github.com/angelozerr) whose implementation of the
[XML Language Server (LemMinX)](https://github.com/angelozerr/lemminx) helped me to understand
how to implement a language server using [Eclipse lsp4j](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4j).  

## Features

### Good-Enough-Support

This language server thinks more in terms of [Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man) than of 
[Ultron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultron). The idea is to support the developer while editing but not
to provide take over the responsibility to write correct syntax. Therefore the source files are just scanned 
but not parsed into an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). Using the 
features should help during typing and navigating, but there is no guarantee that e.g. a completion hint will 
be proper syntax for the current cursor position.

### Features in progress

* [textDocument/completion](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_completion).
* [textDocument/documentSymbol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_documentSymbol).
* [textDocument/publishDiagnostics](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_publishDiagnostics).

My current [TODO](TODO.md) list...  

## Get started

Use use the [Eclipse Installer](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer) to create a separate Eclipse installation
to work on the projects [ls4rexx](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/ls4rexx) and [rexx4e](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/rexx4e).

Start the Eclipse Installer in `Advanced mode`. Select `Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP developers` as the product. 
Product Version should be `Photon` if you want to target IBM Developer for z/OS (starting from version 15.x) or 
Compuware Topaz Workbench (starting from version 20.x). 
On the projects page add an Eclipse Project with the URI 
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/generaliinformatik/rexx4e/master/rexx4e.setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/generaliinformatik/rexx4e/master/rexx4e.setup)
and select the Rexx4e project. After finishing the installation and the start of the project the result is:
* missing plugins will be added to the product
* repositories will be cloned and imported
* repositories will be built using maven

A more manual approach is

* Clone this repository
* Open the folder in your terminal / command line
* Run `./mvnw clean verify` (OSX, Linux) or `mvnw.cmd clean verify` (Windows)
* After successful compilation you can find the resulting `ls4rexx-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the folder `target`

## Developer

To debug ls4rexx you can use `de.generali.dev.ls.test.LServerSocketLauncher`:

1. Run the `de.generali.dev.ls.test.LServerSocketLauncher` in debug mode (e.g. in eclipse)
2. Connect your client via socket port. Default port is 5008, but you can change it with start argument `--port` in step 1

## Clients

Currently there is only the following client available:

* Eclipse IDE support with [rexx4e](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/rexx4e "rexx4e")

## Licenses

ls4rexx is published under the Eclipse Public License 2.0
